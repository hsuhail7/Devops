#Task 1
#You have to do the same using Shell Script i.e using either Loops or command with start day and end day variables using arguments
#So Write a bash script createDirectories.sh that when the script is executed with three given arguments (one is directory name and 
#second is start number of directories and third is the end number of directories ) it creates specified number of directories with a#dynamic directory name.

#Example : ./createDirectories.sh day 1 90   || output should looklike this :creates 90 directories as day1 day2 day3 .... day90

#Task2
#Create a Script to backup all your work done till now.
#Backups are an important part of DevOps Engineers day to Day activities The video in References will help you to understand 
#How a DevOps Engineer takes backups (it can feel a bit difficult but keep trying, Nothing is impossible.)

#Task3
#Read About Cron and Crontab, to automate the backup Script
#Cron is the system's main scheduler for running jobs or tasks unattended. 
#A command called crontab allows the user to submit, edit or delete entries to cron. 
#A crontab file is a user file that holds the scheduling information.

#Task4
#Create 2 users and just display their Usernames
